# Should Tero wear a helmet?

## x) Summaries

Threat modeling manifesto:

- Everyone should do threat modeling
- Threat modeling consists of principles and values
- The threat modeling key questions are:
  1) What are we working on?
  2) What can go wrong?
  3) What are we going to do about it?
  4) Did we do a good enough job?

World's shortest threat modeling course

- Threat modeling is done to anticipate problems before they arise
- Threat modeling is collaborative work, sketching is a big part of this
- Good and professional records and documents must be kept of the work done
- Data flow diagrams are used to show control of entities and how entities are connected
- What can go wrong can be answered using STRIDE, which stands for spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service and elevation of privileges.
- Track your work!
- "Did we do a good enough job?" can be answered with "Did we feel like the work we did was worthwhile?"

Threat modeling cheat sheet

- Use threat modeling to identify risks early on
- Everyone needs to think creatively and outside the box, "like an attacker"
- Threat modeling can be challenging for teams with little to no security knowledge

## a) Security hygiene

- Everyone should always double check sources
- Everyone should keep their software and especially their antivirus up to date
- Both cyber and information security should always be considered when working with computers and sensitive information
- Everything regarding personal or company information should be need-to-know; don't share information with anyone who doesn't need it!

## b) Make-belief boogie man

The company I have imagined for this task is one that sells motorcycles and ATVs both online and in person.

1) What are we working on?
   - Priority assets include payments and banking systems, server for online store, customer and employee information.
   - Customers can use our online store or visit our store in person
   - Tech and security work on the online stuff, business does store stuff and gives parameters for online store

2) What can go wrong?
   - Spoofing: Attacker could acquire employee credentials if not kept secret
   - Tampering: If an attacker accesses unlocked workstation or gets into the systems some other way, they could cause major damage
   - Repudiation: Attacker could modify banking statements and cover their tracks
   - Information disclosure: Attacker could use customer information database for blackmail etc.
   - Denial of Service: Online store could get DDoSsed
   - Elevation of Privilege: Attacker could get admin privileges if system not secure enough
  
   - Biggest and most propable risks: DDoS, Spoofing.
  
   - No expected threat actor
  
   - If banking systems go down, must be ready to take cash and do analog recordkeeping
  
3) What are we going to do about it?
   - Proper infosec and cybersec training for employees
   - Good antivirus on all workstations
   - Never ever write passwords down!!!
   - Have backup plans for when shit goes south
  
4) Did we do a good enough job?
   - Evaluate cyber and infosec regularly
   - Test employees
   - Update software whenever possible
   - Maybe hire other party to do test attacks?
