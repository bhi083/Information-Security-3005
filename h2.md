# Kill Chain


## x) Read and summarize

The following is my summarization bullet points of the article "Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains", by Hutchins et al. Link to article listed in sources below.


- APT or Advanced Persistent Threat is the largest element of risk for some industries. Its use is to compromise data for military or economic advancement.
- APT intrusions happen even at important government agencies
- It is required to know how APT intrusions happen in order to be better prepared for them
- Kill chain models were originally used in a military setting
- There exist a number of different and not-so-different models for phased kill chains for information security
- Intelligence driven CND or Computer Network Defence uses analysis of adversary attributes to better prepare for future attacks. Intelligence driven CND is a continuous process that uses the data gathered from previous attacks to understand future possibilites better.
- In a broad sense, the kill chains for conventional warfare and information security are very similar
- Using a kill chain model, defenders can prepare and predict adversary actions by consulting the chain and taking appropriate actions
- It is important to prepare actions for all possibilities along the kill chain
- Proper training and testing must be done to make sure everyone is ready to combat possible adversaries using the correct methods


I feel like the article was at the same time very thorough and very shallow. The kill chain model at its core is very flexible and can be analyzed and talked about for as long as one feels like talking. Analyzing and slowly perfecting the kill chain model and how to use it both defensively and offensively is the reason it exists.

## a) Bookworm.

In this task, I installed Virtualbox, and then I installed Debian Linux in a virtual machine in Virtualbox. The following is a (bad) techical report on how I did it. The Debian installation tutorial by Tero Karvinen was loosely followed in the process. Link to tutorial in sources below.

1. Installing Virtualbox

First, I downloaded Virtualbox for Windows from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads . 

2. Downloading the Debian 12 ISO

I searched on google "debian 12 download" and clicked the first link. The current newest iso for debian was 12.6. I downloaded it from https://www.debian.org/download . 

3. Setting up the new virtual machine

I opened Virtualbox and clicked "new", then "Expert mode". I named the new virtual machine "Debian 12" I selected the Debian iso I had downloaded as the chosen ISO image. I ticked the box for "Skip unattended installation. I set the base memory 4096 MB and the number of CPU:s to 2. I increased the virtual hard disk size to 30 GB.

The rest of the settings I left on default. I clicked Finish.

4. First boot

On Virtualbox manager, I double-clicked the new "Debian 12" virtual machine I had just created to boot it.

![virtualbox manager](https://github.com/bhi083/Information-Security-3005/blob/main/N%C3%A4ytt%C3%B6kuva%202024-09-01%20011327.png?raw=true "Virtualbox Manager")

The virtual machine opened to a language selection. I typed in 20 to choose English and pressed enter

![language](https://github.com/bhi083/Information-Security-3005/blob/main/N%C3%A4ytt%C3%B6kuva%202024-09-01%20011456.png?raw=true "Language")


Next, to finalize my choosing of language, location and keymap, I typed in the numbers for "other", "Europe",  "Finland", "United States" and "Finnish", in that order.

After some waiting, I typed in the hostname "DebianLab" and the network name "DebianLab.com" I also came up with a very secure root password. I typed in my name when prompted to do so. I used the default username and came up with another very secure password.

I chose to do a guided partitioning of the entire disk. I did not make any changes to the default prompts as I went through the rest of the partitioning process.

I chose deb.debian.org as my mirror. I did not enter proxy information.
