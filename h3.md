Nardone, Disobey 2024: Cybersecurity in the gaming industry

- The speaker, Massimo Nardone, isa 28-year veteran of IT security with his own company
- Cybersecurity in games is important because of, for example, personal information given to companies, intellectual property and copyright laws, cheating in games, and in-game financial transactions
- Cybersecurity attacks can target almost all kinds of games, mostly online multiplayer games with high player counts.
- The gaming market is steadily growing, which also leads to an increase in cyber attacks
- Most common cyber attack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
- Kids games are targeted for scams and malware/phishing
- The more popular the game, the more common it is for there to be cheaters
- You need security standards, frameworks and regulations when dealing with the gaming industry, like all the other industries
- Key Architecture for gaming industry security is platform servers, cloud, web portal and user data
- Cybersecurity best practices for gaming industry are very similar to other IT industry practices

Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

- Command line is always in a directory. Home directory is marked with ~ and root directory with /.
- Files can be manipulated, edited, moved, created and deleted with commands
- ssh can be used to remotely operate a machine
- man and help commands are used in case of troubles
- tab is useful for filling in commands faster than one can type them
- sudo is used for admin commands and asks for admin password first
- apt-get can be used to install software and updates
- Nethack is addicting. No joke I played for an hour before continuing to work.

## a) Bandit oh-five

For this task I did the levels 0-4 of OverTheWire: Bandit.

The first level required me to log in to the game using SSH. The command I used for this was

$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

The next level required me to read the readme file in the home directory of bandit0. I used the cat command to read the file and acquire the password for user bandit1. I then used the same command as the first level to log in as bandit 1.

Level 2 required me to read the password from a file in the home directory called -. for this task I used the command cat < -. 

I solved the third level by using the command cat "spaces in this filename"

For the fourth level I needed to move to the inhere directory by using command cd inhere. The file I needed was hidden, so I used command ls -a to list all files. The file name was ...Hiding-From-You, and I opened it with cat.

## b) Can't fish

I disabled networking on my virtual machine and tried to ping 1.1.1.1. This was the result.

The ping is not going through as I am not connected to the internet. If I was, the command would send packets to 1.1.1.1 and get a return message to confirm the functioning of the network.

## c) Local only

![kuva](https://github.com/bhi083/Information-Security-3005/blob/main/N%C3%A4ytt%C3%B6kuva%202024-09-03%20194011.png?raw=true "localhost scan")

I used the command sudo nmap -A localhost. The command scanned the 1000 most common TCP ports. The results are as follows:

- The first line is simply the URL for nmap
- The second line tells me that there is no DNS. This is because the computer is not connected to the internet, which is good
- Then the results tell me that this is a portscan for localhost 127.0.0.1
- The results show that 1000 ports were scanned and 999 were filtered due to not being open or some other reason
- The one open port is port 631 which is the internet printing protocol port
- The results also show the device and device OS and network distance in hops. This is because we used -A in our command. It also shows headers and banners.


## d) Daemon

After port scanning localhost with nmap, I downloaded Apache web server using apt-get and did the same scan again. This was the result:

As we can see, it now shows 2 interesting ports: port 80 is in use by the Apache web server plugin. Port 80 is the default TCP port for HTTP web servers. The scan tells us the port number, protocol, state, service and version of the plugin and server header and title. Otherwise, the scan results are the same as last time.
