Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

- Command line is always in a directory. Home directory is marked with ~ and root directory with /.
- Files can be manipulated, edited, moved, created and deleted with commands
- ssh can be used to remotely operate a machine
- man and help commands are used in case of troubles
- tab is useful for filling in commands faster than one can type them
- sudo is used for admin commands and asks for admin password first
- apt-get can be used to install software and updates
- Nethack is addicting. No joke I played for an hour before continuing to work.

## a) Bandit oh-five

For this task I did the levels 0-4 of OverTheWire: Bandit.

The first level required me to log in to the game using SSH. The command I used for this was

$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

The next level required me to read the readme file in the home directory of bandit0. I used the cat command to read the file and acquire the password for user bandit1. I then used the same command as the first level to log in as bandit 1.

Level 2 required me to read the password from a file in the home directory called -. for this task I used the command cat < -. 

I solved the third level by using the command cat "spaces in this filename"

For the fourth level I needed to move to the inhere directory by using command cd inhere. The file I needed was hidden, so I used command ls -a to list all files. The file name was ...Hiding-From-You, and I opened it with cat.

## b) Can't fish

I disablet networking on my virtual machine and tried to ping 1.1.1.1. This was the result.
