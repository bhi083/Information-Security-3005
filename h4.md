A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

- Refers to situations in which users are able to act outside of their intended access boundaries
- Can happen by accident, by URL modification, using user unique identifiers, elevation of privilege etc.
- Can be prevented by denying by default, storing metadata and backup files securely, logging access failures and alerting admins

A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

- Security misconfigurations are extremely common
- Misconfigurations such as: unnecessary features, default accounts enabled, security features being disabled, wrongful error handling
- Can be prevented by repeating hardening processes, keeping the platform minimal with no unnecessary features, automating security effectiveness checks

A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

- Components and software are often vulnerable to attacks if they are outdated or if the user does not know the versions of the components
- The risk of vulnerable components rests on both the user and software developers, who need to test compatability periodically
- To prevent component vulnerabilities, one should only obtain components through official means. It is also recommended to check both client-side and server-side components and their versions every now and then

A03:2021 - Injection

- Injection attacks can happen if user-supplied data is not filtered or if hostile data is directly used
- Can be prevented by validating user-supplied data packets and using a safe API. LIMIT and other SQL controls are also available
