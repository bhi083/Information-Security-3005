## x) Summaries

Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Plaintext is a message, disguising the message is encryption, an encrypted message is ciphertext, and turning ciphertext into plaintext is decryption.
- Cryptography is the science of keeping messages secure
- Cryptanalysis is the science of breaking ciphertext
- Cryptology is the mathematics that includes both cryptography and cryptanalysis
- For mathematics purposes, plaintext is M or P, ciphertext is C encryption is E and decryption is D. The act of encrypting a plaintext message can then be written as E(M) = C
- Cryptography is used for both confidentiality and authentication
- Keys are used for encryption and decryption. Key = K
- Cryptanalysis is decrypting a message without the required key
- There are multiple types of cryptanalytic attacks
- Steganography is the act of hiding a message in another message
- Messages can also be hidden in images
- Substitution ciphers substitute the characters in plaintext for other characters in ciphertext
- Transposition ciphers shuffle the plaintext characters around
- Rotor machines can be used to create ciphers, the most well-known rotor machine is the Enigma
- XOR ciphers are very simple but still widely used in software
- One-time pad encryption uses the plaintext and randomized key only once, thus making it technically perfect
- The three most common cryptographic algorithm are DES, RSA and DSA
- The numbers used when talking about cryptography can get pretty huge

Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg

- In order to send encrypted messages, the parties involved need each other's public keys
- gpg can be used to create secret and public keys for use in sending encrypted messages
- Secret keys are secret and public keys are public
- After verifying a public key as legitimate, it can be signed as such
- Signed and trusted keys are needed for sending encrypted messages
- Both users need to verify each other's keys
- Once a message has been written and encrypted, it can only be decrypted with the recipient's key
- The recipient can trust the message because it was sent by a verified key

## a) Pretty Good indeed

For this task, I was supposed to encrypt and decrypt a message using PGP public key cryptography. I did this by following Tero Karvinen's instructions linked in the sources.

I started by updating and installing the required tools

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

Next, I generated a keypair

$ gpg --gen-key

When prompted, I entered a name and email. I then confirmed that I do not want to add a password (twice).

I can now view my keypair with $ gpg --fingerprint. The keypair consists of a public key and secret key. The public key is what I will be using today.

I need to export my public key to a file.

$ gpg --export --armor --output jaakko.pub

Now the key is in jaakko.pub, in ASCII characters.

Next, we are going to simulate a person to send the key to, since we are Linux users and have no actual friends. We will simulate the person with a folder.

$ mkdir liisa/
$ chmod og-rwx liisa/

Next, we will generate Liisa her own keyring

$ cd liisa/
$ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

When simulating Liisa, commands will be run in her home directory and begin with "gpg --homedir .".

$ gpg --homedir . --gen-key

I once again enter a name and email, and confirm that no password is needed.

Now, lets import and verify keys.

$ cd
$ cp -v jaakko.pub liisa/

cd
