## x) Summaries

Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Plaintext is a message, disguising the message is encryption, an encrypted message is ciphertext, and turning ciphertext into plaintext is decryption.
- Cryptography is the science of keeping messages secure
- Cryptanalysis is the science of breaking ciphertext
- Cryptology is the mathematics that includes both cryptography and cryptanalysis
- For mathematics purposes, plaintext is M or P, ciphertext is C encryption is E and decryption is D. The act of encrypting a plaintext message can then be written as E(M) = C
- Cryptography is used for both confidentiality and authentication
- Keys are used for encryption and decryption. Key = K
- Cryptanalysis is decrypting a message without the required key
- There are multiple types of cryptanalytic attacks
- Steganography is the act of hiding a message in another message
- Messages can also be hidden in images
- Substitution ciphers substitute the characters in plaintext for other characters in ciphertext
- Transposition ciphers shuffle the plaintext characters around
- Rotor machines can be used to create ciphers, the most well-known rotor machine is the Enigma
- XOR ciphers are very simple but still widely used in software
- One-time pad encryption uses the plaintext and randomized key only once, thus making it technically perfect
- The three most common cryptographic algorithm are DES, RSA and DSA
- The numbers used when talking about cryptography can get pretty huge

Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg

- In order to send encrypted messages, the parties involved need each other's public keys
- gpg can be used to create secret and public keys for use in sending encrypted messages
- Secret keys are secret and public keys are public
- After verifying a public key as legitimate, it can be signed as such
- Signed and trusted keys are needed for sending encrypted messages
- Both users need to verify each other's keys
- Once a message has been written and encrypted, it can only be decrypted with the recipient's key
- The recipient can trust the message because it was sent by a verified key

## a) Pretty Good indeed

For this task, I was supposed to encrypt and decrypt a message using PGP public key cryptography. I did this by following Tero Karvinen's instructions linked in the sources.

I started by updating and installing the required tools

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

Next, I generated a keypair

$ gpg --gen-key

When prompted, I entered a name and email. I then confirmed that I do not want to add a password (twice).

I can now view my keypair with $ gpg --fingerprint. The keypair consists of a public key and secret key. The public key is what I will be using today.

I need to export my public key to a file.

$ gpg --export --armor --output jaakko.pub

Now the key is in jaakko.pub, in ASCII characters.

Next, we are going to simulate a person to send the key to, since we are Linux users and have no actual friends. We will simulate the person with a folder.

$ mkdir liisa/

$ chmod og-rwx liisa/

Next, we will generate Liisa her own keyring

$ cd liisa/

$ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

When simulating Liisa, commands will be run in her home directory and begin with "gpg --homedir .".

$ gpg --homedir . --gen-key

I once again enter a name and email, and confirm that no password is needed.

Now, lets import and verify keys.

$ cd

$ cp -v jaakko.pub liisa/

$ cd liisa/

$ gpg --homedir . import jaakko.pub

Now Liisa has Jaakko's key. They can check the fingerprint to verify it as such.

$ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

Once Liisa is sure that the key is from Jaakko, they can sign it.

$ gpg --homedir . sign-key "KEYTEXTHERE"

Now we can see that the key from Jaakko is fully trusted

$ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

Now only to do the same, but with Liisa sending her key to Jaakko

$ gpg --homedir . --export --armor --output liisa.pub

$ cp - liisa/liisa.pub .

$ cd

$cp -v liisa/liisa.pub

$ gpg --import liisa.pub

$ gpg --sign-key "KEYTEXTHERE

$ gpg --fingerprint

With this string of commands, both users now have each others public keys, and have verified them as actually being the people they say they are.

Now, we can finally actually send a message.

Liisa writes message that she wants to send to Jaakko:

$ cd ~/liisa/

$ micro viesti.txt

She then encrypts and signs the message

$ gpg --homedir . --encrypt --recipient jaakko@example.com.invalid --sign --output encrypted.pgp --armor viesti.txt

Now we can send the message

$ cp -v liisa/encrypted.pgp .

Now Jaakko can decrypt the message

$ gpg --decrypt encrypted.pgp

And that's it! Pretty easy and user-friendly once the basics are established.

## b) Password manager, open and cloudless

Using a password manager is reallllly important, as it can help with not using the same easy-to-guess password with all logins. The password manager being cloudless is important because cloud managers can be hacked and the user can't do much about it. Most password managers can automatically generate strong passwords and store them at the ready for when the user needs them.

For this task, I chose to use and KeePass, which is a free, open-source cloudless password manager.

I downloaded KeePass from their website linked in the sources.

Running the setup, I first chose a language, read and accepted the aggreements and selected a download destination. I chose to download all components. Last thing to do is to click install.

After downloading, I now needed to create a new password database by clicking File -> New. Then I needed to specify the location of the database file and choose a Master Key for the file.

After picking out the name and description for the database, we can now access it.

To add a new password to the database, we right-click on the right window and choose "Add entry".

Here, we can add the Title of the entry, the User name and Password, as well as other stuff.

After creating a new entry, all we need to do is click "Save Database" on the toolbar. That's it! Very simple and easy to use, with no useless and unneeded features blocking the way.
