Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: One-way functions and one-way hash functions

- One-way functions are easy to calculate but very hard to reverse
- Mathematically, one-way functions might not exist, but some functions act as something very close to a proper one-way function
- A trapdoor one-way function is one that is easy to calculate and difficult to reverse, unless one know the secret information of how to reverse it
- A hash function takes an input of any length and converts it to an output of a fixed length
- A one-way hash function is the same but one-way, and thus much more secure
- Changing a single bit in the input value changes about half of the bits in the hash value
- A message authentication code or MAC is a one-way hash function with a secret key

## a) Install Hashcat

I installed Hashcat by following the tutorial by Tero Karvinen. I then tested to see how it works using a simple hash.

First, I installed Hashcat.

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget

Then, I created a new directory to work in

$ mkdir hashed

$ cd hashed

After that, I downloaded a large dictionary for hash cracking using wget, and opened the zip.

$ https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

$ tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

$ rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Rockyou is a very popular dictionary for hashes, with over 14 million words

In order to crack a hash, we need to know what type of hash we are cracking. To get the type, we can use hashid

The correct hash type is usually one of the top 3.

For this one, we will try to crack it with MD5.

hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved

After calculating for a second, Hashcat saves the solved text into the file specified, in this case 'solved'.

As we can see, the hash was 'summer'.

## b) Crack this hash

For this exercise, the task was to crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

First, we need to figure out what type of hash it is.

Let's try cracking it with MD5

$ hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved

(I did this earlier but forgot to get a screenshot of the output. Here is what I get when I use --show instead of -o solved:

Well that was easy.
