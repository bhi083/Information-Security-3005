Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

- Tor still provides anonymity despite attempts to compromise it
- Tor is useful for non-criminal tasks as well
- Tor doesn't have a backdoor
- Tor is easy to use, but also not foolproof. You will be compromised if you use Tor incorrectly

Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser

- Tor browser is a modified firefox browser that hides the users IP address
- Tor was initially developed by the US government, but nowadays is not controlled by any one entity
- Tor directs the user's traffic through multiple relays
- The relays strip away layers of encryption (layers, like an onion)
- Anyone can voluntarily make a server that works as a Tor relay
- Downloading and using Tor is as easy as any othe application
- Supposedly, the FBI has managed to break TOR once
- The biggest weakness of the TOR browser is the user. Something like allowing websites to view the user's location could compromise the user.
- Getting into communication with a user makes it easier to track them. For example, seeded emails can be used to figure out the user's true IP address

## a) Install TOR

I installed TOR browser in class, so this explanation will be written from memory.

I started by going to https://www.torproject.org/download/ in my Debian virtual machine and downloading Tor Browser for Linux.

The download package was downloaded into /home/jaakko/Downloads/. I unzipped the package using command $ tar -xvzf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.5.6.tar.xz

After unzipping, I navigated to the correct directory with cd tor browser and cd Browser.

After that, I started up the browser with ./start-tor-browser.

Once the browser had started, I connected to the Tor network by clicking connect

## b) Browse TOR

Tero told us about a Tor search engine called Ahmia during the lesson, which is the one I used for this task. Ahmia is made by a Finnish guy and can be used to search the Tor network and dark web.

I searched for "market" on Ahmia and found Venus Marketplace. They advertise themselves as being one of the best marketplaces on the Darknet. They sell illegal drugs and weapons, among other contraband.

I searched for "forum" on Ahmia and found Internet Archive Forums. It seems to be a general forum page, with discussions about software, audio, computers and movies.

For the real-world organisation's page, I found the CIA page we tried to find during the class. I didn't find it using Ahmia though, I just googled for the onion URL on clearweb. The CIA darknet site's primary purpose seems to be so that people can leave anonymous tips for the CIA.
